# Dravid Joseph.

I'm a software engineer based in the San Francisco Bay Area.  Currently, I work as a Software Development Engineer (SDE) for [Amazon Key For Business](https://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&node=18530497011).

I support services related to the [Ring Intercom](https://en-uk.ring.com/products/intercom) and the [Ring Access Controller Pro](https://ring.com/products/access-controller-pro-2).  I mostly support the backend, although I have to coordinate with Ring app and Alexa folks regularly as well to make sure everything works.

Amazon famously has a service-oriented architecture and as a result I end up wearing a lot of different hats.  I coordinate with product managers to help design features and end up implementing those features, but Amazon SDEs are generally responsible for maintaining the code pipeline, building up and tearing down service infrastructure, ensuring adequate test coverage, and participating in on-call rotations.

In my free time, I work out with a [personal trainer](https://www.reddotfitness.net), try to spend quality time with my family, and try to get various house projects under control.

### Contact me

I try to avoid social media; If you want to contact me the best place to do so would be at [my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dravidjoseph/).  I have accounts with all the major social media platforms but it's unlikely that I'll respond.
